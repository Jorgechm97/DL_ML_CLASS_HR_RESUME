# Classification of CVs by Category

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to classify CVs by category, in order to facilitate the selection of profiles in recruitment and selection processes.

## Project Description

In this project, a CV dataset obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snehaanbhawal/resume-dataset) has been used, which includes a variety of categories such as Software Developer, Data Analyst, Graphic Designer, etc. An exploratory analysis of the data, text cleaning and preprocessing has been performed.

Two classification models have been implemented:
1. **Naive Bayes Model**: Using TF-IDF to vectorize the text and the Naive Bayes algorithm to classify the CVs.
2. **Deep Learning Model**: Using a neural network with TensorFlow and Keras to classify the CVs.

## Repository Structure

- `notebooks/` : Jupyter Notebooks with the data analysis and model implementation.
- `model_resume_classification_HR.keras` : Trained Deep Learning model.
- `README.md` : Detailed information about the project.

## Results and Metrics

- The Naive Bayes model achieved 52.92% accuracy in classifying resumes.
- The Deep Learning model achieved 96.13% accuracy in classifying resumes.

## Additional Information

- Visualizations of the most frequent resume categories and an analysis of the most relevant keywords in each category are provided.
- Charts showing the distribution of categories in the dataset are included.
